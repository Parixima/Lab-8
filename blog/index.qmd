Dissemination is fundamental to science and is an integral part of the professional journey of investigators. This enables researchers to share their findings to contribute to the bank of evidence in their field. While reading the book “How to be a modern scientist” by Jeff Leek, I found the idea of submitting preprints an interesting approach to dissemination within the scientific community. 

The traditional process of publishing one’s work can be tedious and take months or even years. Anyone who has ever tried submitting their paper to a peer-reviewed journal can relate to the challenges of having their paper accepted for publication. The multiple rejections and time-extensive revisions have often been common barriers to researchers’ being able to share their work in a timely manner. Thus, preprints can be an alternative for researchers to share their work and study findings in a more time effective manner, such as within a few days rather than waiting for peer-review and formal publication. 

By sharing their work, authors can get feedback from other researchers and experts, which can subsequently help in improving their manuscripts prior to submission. This can increase the chances of publications in higher-tiered journal with higher impact factor. 
Preprints can help researchers share their work via platforms such as arXiv, biorXiv, and PeerJ without any lengthy and expensive process. As they share their preprints, researchers become visible to their field and the scientific community, hence this can help researchers gain recognition in their field. Through preprints, researchers and especially junior researchers can gauge the interest of experts and senior researchers which can consequently create opportunities for collaborations.  

In comparison to peer-reviewed formal publications, preprints can be accessed easily without the need of paying for subscriptions or articles, which can be expensive. Thus, preprints can cater to a wider audience especially those located in resource-limited settings, such as low- and middle-income countries. Within these resource-limited settings, there are often financial barriers to scientific information and literature, which limits the type of information investigators can access. So, preprints can establish a model of dissemination which promotes inclusivity and allows a broader audience of investigators, students, and the public, to access scientific information without paywalls. On a more personal level, by sharing pre-prints, researchers especially junior researchers can have a sense of accomplishment, and this can help them to keep thriving and make improvements. 

However, despite the multiple advantages of pre-prints, researchers and scientists must be cautious and critical about how they interpret the findings from preprints. Since preprints have not been through the process of peer review, the quality, reliability and validity of findings can be of debatable value. Pre-prints can be a great way for investigators to share their work to a wider audience in a timely manner, nevertheless the findings of pre-prints should be critically analyzed.
